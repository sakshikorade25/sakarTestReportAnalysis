# Sakar The Medical Portal

Objective:

We reliazed that dozens of hard copies of medical reports makes it difficult to keep track of. Hard copy of reports makes them succesptible to tearing or damage. Soft copies are stores in a 
distributed fashion. Medical reports are very important for diagnoisis of the disease and to keep track of treatment. Our Sakar Medical Portal offers to keep track of these medical 
parameters. It is a medium for lay man to simply understand the complex medical world.

Brief:
- Portal to keep a track of medical reports and for easy visual presentation
- Scan medical reports using camera or upload image or pdf file
- Implementation of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to extract textual data from the report as a json object
- Cleaning the data and retaining data required for implementation i.e. the date and relevant paramters
- Everytime a new report is scanned by a particular user, the latest details along with date is appended to the same json file inorder to maintain record
- Plot this data on a line-area chart for visually demonstrating the parameter effect over time period
